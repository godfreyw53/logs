# connection-to-mongodb
Project to learn connection to Mongodb using Compass Atlas and Cloud MongoDb
with this project i have learnt the core principles in learning my first database connection.
i have used mongodb and nodejs
i initially created a signUp and Login form that could help me to implement all this.
the following are the packages i installed express, mongoose, path, ejs, nodemon, bcryptjs,app
the packages have different use in this project as i will explain below
#express is used since it is robust, unopionionated web application framewwork that speed up server-side developent
#mongoose is the backborn of connecting to the Mongodb
#app is the environment of operation
#bycryptjs will be essentail for hashing passwords before we store them in db
#path is essential in the sense our app is able to operate on different platform with ease due to CORS
#ejs creates an environment for writing our HTML files
#nodemon we used it because it helps us set an environment through which our server restart if we have any changes in our index.js file.
you are encourages to follow the code and share your thoughts and also i am learning new techniques of JWT so feel free encourage and any material for learning easily
#view folder has all the ejs files 
#public folder has has style.css 
#src has the index.js and mongodb.js file 
under index.js we have const collection that is imported from our Mongodb
so you can use any name provided after you have created a new connection and new model remember to export the collection so that it can be use in index.js file. 
thanks so much,
